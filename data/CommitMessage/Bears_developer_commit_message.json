With Spring 5 an index file can be used by the scanner, which in turn will cause AnnotatedGenericBeanDefinition instances being returned. That caused the code path to lookup the first constructor argument to kick in (usually used to obtain the repository interface from repository factory beans) and cause a NullPointerException.

We no longer cache argument arrays in our EntityInstantiators to prevent changes to shared mutable state caused by reentrant calls.  Previously, a re-entrant call requesting an argument array of the same size as a previous call in the call stack reused the same array instance. Changes to this shared mutable state by multiple invocations caused an invalid state rendering wrong parameters for object instantiation. Removing the caching and only reusing an empty array for zero-arg constructors is the only safe approach for now.

This fixes #448    * Small fix on the reasoning comment    * Adjust the test to act more like the ShardConsumer    The ShardConsuemr, which is the principal user of the  PrefetchRecordsPublisher, uses RxJava to consume from publisher. This  test uses RxJava to consume, and notifies the test thread once  MAX_ITEMS * 3 have been received. This ensures that we cycle through  the queue at least 3 times.    * Removed the upper limit on the retrievals    The way RxJava's request management makes it possible that more  requests than we might expect can happen.", "bears-200": "Merge pull request #884 from AxonFramework/bugfix/883  Do not try to convert a null source, provide an empty string instead.", "bears-201": "Fix unit test breakage.", "bears-202": "Merge pull request #278 from larsgrefer/fix/gh-277  Fix #277", "bears-203": "make test green", "bears-204": "Added equals methods to pass tests", "bears-205": "Merge pull request #1586 from zouyx/master  Block delete default cluster", "bears-206": "#180 - Tests and fixes around rtl overflow pages.", "bears-207": "Merge 59cc404c100c6be2544fe52529e4cbb049343293 into ad529743c8029074d7ab59f2d1b471572b49a2aa", "bears-208": "DBZ-927 Gracefully handling invalid default values for timestamp fields", "bears-209": "Improved eviction strategy for lock holder - Locks that doesn't hold by any thread and neither one thread are waiting to acquire this lock - Implemented logic in accordance with specifications", "bears-210": "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/dungba88/libra", "bears-211": "Fix #153", "bears-212": "Merge pull request #112 from vboulaye/closed-stream-when-autoclose-disabled  fix #99 do not close stream when autoclose is disabled in yaml generator/parser", "bears-213": "Merge pull request #3 from fraenkelc/pageable_on_custom_method  Pageable on custom method", "bears-214": "Merge branch 'null-rackId' into staging", "bears-215": "fix(ImportScanner): unused imports should not be added (#2486)", "bears-216": "fix: compiled snippets have no parent (#2503)", "bears-217": "Merge aa1b0121e34ba490729b07019fc5188c25fb3102 into 51e64eb8924b7a33d4d87608d0e83f374e82c0ef", "bears-218": "fix: CtPackageDeclaration has a valid source position (#2760)", "bears-219": "fix: parsing of java version not starting with \"1.\" in pom.xml (#2729)  * Check if java.version contains a dot in pom.xml    * cover all cases and added an Assert in MavenLauncherTest    * (style) added a missing whitespace    fix #2714", "bears-220": "Fix array convertion in U.toXml(map).", "bears-221": "[JENKINS-54133] Pregenerating console notes sent to agents for some common cases (#128)  * [JENKINS-54133] Pregenerating console notes sent to agents for some common cases.    * Changelog entry.", "bears-222": "Fixed bug in Watts-Strogatz Generator (#699)  * Fixed bug in Watts-Strogatz Generator     The problem manifested when the vertices are not integers.    * Minor optimization", "bears-223": "Merge pull request #4 from julianps/Fix-null-value-Issue  Fixed npe when context holds a null source-value", "bears-224": "added tests for pipelines and fixed the problem of encountering runtime exceptions", "bears-225": "Consider value multiplicity in reactive output resolution #879  Lettuce now checks for the value multiplicity when resolving the actual output type for reactive Redis commands methods.

We now fall back to reflection-based PropertyAccessor/EntityInstantiator strategies when framework types are not visible by the entity's ClassLoader.  Typically, we use class generation to create and load PropertyAccessor and EntityInstantiator classes to bypass reflection. Generated types are injected into the ClassLoader that has loaded the actual entity. Generated classes implement framework types such as ObjectInstantiator and these interfaces must be visible to the ClassLoader that hosts the generated class. Some arrangements, such as OSGi isolate class repositories so the OSGi class loader cannot load our own types which prevents loading the generated class.
