That caused the code path to lookup the first constructor argument to kick in (usually used to obtain the repository interface from repository factory beans) and cause a NullPointerException.

Changes to this shared mutable state by multiple invocations caused an invalid state rendering wrong parameters for object instantiation.

We now fall back to reflection-based PropertyAccessor/EntityInstantiator strategies when framework types are not visible by the entity's ClassLoader.

Generated classes implement framework types such as ObjectInstantiator and these interfaces must be visible to the ClassLoader that hosts the generated class.
