{"id":1,"summary":"Potential NPE in AbstractCategoryItemRender.getLegendItems()","description": "Setting up a working copy of the current JFreeChart trunk in Eclipse I got a warning about a null pointer access in this bit of code from AbstractCategoryItemRender.java. The warning is in the last code line where seriesCount is assigned. The variable dataset is guaranteed to be null in this location, I suppose that the check before that should actually read \"if (dataset == null)\", not \"if (dataset != null)\"."}
