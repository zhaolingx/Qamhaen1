{"id":16,"summary":"Bug propgated from v1.0.5 on to present","description": "The method getRowCount() in class org.jfree.data.category.DefaultIntervalCategoryDataset says that it \"Returns the number of series in the dataset (possibly zero).\"\n\nThe implementation from v1.0.5 on no longer checks for a null condition (which would then return a zero) on the seriesKeys as it did in v1.0.4 and previous. This now throws a Null Pointer if seriesKeys never got initialized and the getRowCount() method is called."}
