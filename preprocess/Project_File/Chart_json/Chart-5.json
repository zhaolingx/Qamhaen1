{"id":5,"summary":"XYSeries.addOrUpdate() should add if duplicates are allowed","description": "I've found a bug in jfreechart-1.0.9 code for org.jfree.data.xy.XYSeries. There was a change some time ago which introduced the notion of allowing duplicate X values in XYSeries data. The method addOrUpdate(Number x, Number y) was never modified to support this, and therefore duplicate data were overwriting existing data."}
