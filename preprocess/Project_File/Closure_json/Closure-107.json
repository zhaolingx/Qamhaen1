The compiler is using the prefix \u0027MSG_\u0027 internally - which is conflicting with your variable names.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like the compiler should use a prefix less likely to collide with user prefixes. Something like \u0027JSCompiler_MSG_\u0027. However I\u0027m unsure of the impact this would have on internal Google projects. But if this is the case, then the prefix should be moved to a coding convention at a minimum.","timestamp":1384267193,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":-3325454697554823320,"content":"Ok.

The way closure-compiler\u0027s translation system works is that it looks for all variables with the name MSG_ and tries to translate them.
