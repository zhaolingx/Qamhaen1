{"id":937,"status":"Fixed","summary":"Casting a function before calling it produces bad code and breaks plugin code","labels":["Type-Defect","Priority-Medium"],"stars":0,"commentCount":3,"comments":[{"id":0,"commenterId":177012085138132463,"content":"1. Compile this code with ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS:\r\nconsole.log( /** @type {function(!string):!string} */ ((new window.ActiveXObject( \u0027ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash\u0027 ))[\u0027GetVariable\u0027])( \u0027$version\u0027 ) );\r\n\r\nproduces:\r\n\r\n\u0027use strict\u0027;console.log((0,(new window.ActiveXObject(\u0026quot;ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash\u0026quot;)).GetVariable)(\u0026quot;$version\u0026quot;));\r\n\r\n2. Compare with this code:\r\nconsole.log( /** @type {!string} */ ((new window.ActiveXObject( \u0027ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash\u0027 ))[\u0027GetVariable\u0027]( \u0027$version\u0027 )) )\r\n\r\nproduces:\r\n\r\n\u0027use strict\u0027;console.log((new window.ActiveXObject(\u0026quot;ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash\u0026quot;)).GetVariable(\u0026quot;$version\u0026quot;));\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice the (0,...) wrapping around the GetVariable function in the first example. This causes the call to fail in every browser (this code is IE-only but it\u0027s just for a minimal example). The second version produces a warning that the type of GetVariable could not be determined (I enabled type warnings), and it wouldn\u0027t be possible to define these in an externs file without making a horrible mess.\r\n\r\nThis applies to all cases where functions are cast, but only causes problems (other than bloat) with plugins like this. It seems to serve no purpose whatsoever, so I assume it is a bug.\r\n\r\nRunning on a mac, not sure what version but it reports Built on: 2013/02/12 17:00, so will have been downloaded about that time.","timestamp":1362505862,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-5060162230523776870,"content":"Well drat.
