For example, both Closure Builder and plovr automatically manage dependencies for all compilation levels.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change (see attached diff) does not automatically manage dependencies, but it enables dependency management if either --manage_closure_dependencies or --only_closure_dependencies is specified, or if at least one --closure_entry_point is specified.\r\n\r\nThe attached diff passed the JUnit tests: ant test\r\n","timestamp":1333930130,"attachments":[{"id":7030000000,"fileName":"Compiler.java.patch","fileSize":476}]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"soungs good to me.","timestamp":1333984455,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":-7699928860083865744,"content":"This issue was closed by revision r1879.","timestamp":1334081517,"attachments":[]}]}
