{"id":851,"status":"Fixed","summary":"Compiler ignores \u0027delete\u0027 statements, can break functionality.","labels":["Type-Defect","Priority-High"],"stars":0,"commentCount":4,"comments":[{"id":0,"commenterId":-727025857859413995,"content":"When the compiler rewrites internally-referenced object variables to non-object  variables, as in the example below, it ignores \u0027delete\u0027 statements. These delete statements work as expected with the objects originally written, but don\u0027t function the same when the variables are no longer object properties. See:\r\n\r\n(function(arg) {\r\n  var foo \u003d {};\r\n\r\n  foo.bar \u003d arg;\r\n\r\n  console.log(foo.bar);\r\n\r\n  delete foo.bar;\r\n\r\n  console.log(foo.bar);\r\n})();\r\n\r\nCompiles to (simple setting):\r\n(function(a){console.log(a);delete a;console.log(a)})();\r\n\r\nPerhaps the compiler needs to look for these delete statements and change them to setting the rewritten variable to undefined instead.","timestamp":1351896712,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-5060162230523776870,"content":"Thanks for the report.","timestamp":1351904451,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":-5060162230523776870,"content":"","timestamp":1353511440,"attachments":[]},{"id":3,"commenterId":1328304962299559429,"content":"This issue was closed by revision r2343.","timestamp":1353537299,"attachments":[]}]}
