This is because the compiler renamed the reference to\r\n[1,2,3] in `showVersions()` to \u0026quot;Glow.a\u0026quot;, whilst the user assigned a new\r\narray to \u0026quot;Glow.versions\u0026quot;, and therefore the two different names now refer\r\nto two different arrays.\r\n\r\nI can avoid this by using the stringy-name to refer to Glow[\u0026quot;versions\u0026quot;],\r\nbut I would then have to do that everywhere in my code which is a annoying\r\nand bug-prone (if I or someone else should ever forget). I\u0027d prefer to tell\r\nthe compiler once about my wish to have a property name left uncompresed,\r\nrather than relying on a side effect (the fact that the compiler won\u0027t\r\ncompress stringy-named properties) and then having to invoke that\r\nside-effect consistently everywhere.\r\n\r\nInstead I\u0027m requesting that when the compiler sees a property is marked by\r\nthe author as @public it should then leave that name uncompressed everywhere.\r\n\r\nSo, given the input code above, the desired output would be:\r\n\r\n\tGlow \u003d {};\r\n\tGlow.versions \u003d [1, 2, 3];\r\n\tGlow.b \u003d function() { alert(Glow.versions) };\r\n\twindow.Glow \u003d Glow;\r\n\tGlow.versions \u003d Glow.versions; // not needed now\r\n\tGlow.showVersions \u003d Glow.b\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not fixed on a particular tag, but @public seems an obvious choice, and\r\nI\u0027d prefer to use tags that already exist in JsDoc Toolkit.\r\n\r\nNote that my proposed feature is different than the `@export Glow.versions`\r\ntag proposal, as that tag would merely be a shortcut for \u0026quot;Glow[\u0027versions\u0027]\r\n\u003d Glow.versions;\u0026quot;, which, as I\u0027ve shown above, doesn\u0027t solve this problem.\r\n","timestamp":1259927868,"attachments":[]},{"id":1,"commenterId":-5060162230523776870,"content":"","timestamp":1259954357,"attachments":[]},{"id":2,"commenterId":-5060162230523776870,"content":"The work-around is to use a setter:\r\n\r\nGlow.setVersions(acceptedVersions) {\r\n  Glow.versions \u003d acceptedVersions; \r\n}\r\n\r\nwindow[\u0027Glow\u0027][\u0027setVersions\u0027] \u003d Glow.setVersions;","timestamp":1259970321,"attachments":[]},{"id":3,"commenterId":-1159439767172192596,"content":"Adding setters (and getters) for every property we want to expose is *a* workaround, but it\u0027s hardly better \r\nthan referring to them with strings internally; I\u0027d say it\u0027s worse actually because it alters our public API \r\nand makes everything slower in the process.

The lack of a @public annotation currently prevents me from\r\nusing advanced optimizations at all because using stringy-named properties everywhere\r\nisn\u0027t an option because it makes the code much less readable.\r\n\r\n@micmath: Setters are NOT an option because then you have the same problem with the\r\nsetters. The compiler creates an alias for the setter. This alias is used internally.\r\nWhen you do some inheritance now and override the setter then third-party code is\r\nusing the new setter but internally the old setter is still used (because the alias\r\nis used). And that\u0027s bad for class inheritance.\r\n\r\n@ithinkihaveacat: Using externs is not working because the compiler complains about\r\nredefined stuff when the externs file has the same stuff in it as the source code to\r\nbe compiled. Maybe this was working with an earlier version of the Closure\r\nCompiler... And I think it is not correct anyway to define \"local\" stuff in an\r\nexterns file.\r\n\r\nI recommend implementing two annotations:\r\n\r\n1. @public annotation to mark symbols so they are NOT aliased at all. So this is the\r\nsame as using stringy-named properties everywhere. By the way: @protected symbols\r\nmust also not be aliased because third-party code may want to extend the method. Only\r\n@private symbols can always be aliased.\r\n\r\n2. @final annotation to mark symbols as final. This means that the compiler is\r\nallowed to create an alias for a symbol which is defined @public or @protected\r\nbecause it is not allowed to override this property anyway, so the alias is always\r\nstable.\r\n","timestamp":1268670989,"attachments":[]},{"id":6,"commenterId":2197026629195026115,"content":"Comment deleted","timestamp":1277420918,"attachments":[]},{"id":7,"commenterId":-5060162230523776870,"content":"\"@public\" would never apply to functions within a closure as they are not accessible.
