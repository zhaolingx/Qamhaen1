{"id":11,"summary":"Fixed DelegatingMethod.equals() so that it's easier to extend Mockito by custom verification modes","description": "Currently if you create a DelegatingMethod and compare it to itself using .equals() it will show as not equal because the .equals() method expects a java.lang.reflect.Method (without explicitly stating such). This has a knock on effect on the evaluation of InvocationImpl.equals() which at runtime may be using a DelegatingMethod in its .equals()."}
