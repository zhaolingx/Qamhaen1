{"id":3,"summary":"ArgumentCaptor no longer working for varargs","description": "When upgrading 1.10.8, the verify passes, but the getValue() fails with this error. One other piece of info came to light as a result of creating the MCVE - the test works fine if the Date is the only element passed for bindVariables. That is, remove \"var1\" from target and test code, then the test runs fine under 1.9.5 and 1.10.8. Also, it doesn't matter that the captor is for a Date. The same issue occurs if the parameter is of another type, such as Integer."}
