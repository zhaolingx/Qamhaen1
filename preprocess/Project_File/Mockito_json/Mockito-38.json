{"id":38,"summary":"Generate change list separated by types using labels","description": "As discussed on the mailing list instead of one big list of \"Improvements\" the change list for the release is divided into change types based on labels. It is required to specify which labels should be considered separately. Some other labels can be excluded (like \"question\" or \"refactoring\"). There is also headerForOtherChanges method to override default \"Other\" header."}
