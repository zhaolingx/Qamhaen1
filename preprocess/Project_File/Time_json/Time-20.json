{"id":20,"summary":"Errors creating/parsing dates with specific time zones.","description": "The results are out of 572 time zones 130 fail and 30 throw exceptions.\n\nThe failures are the most interesting. When I query DateTimeZone to get its time zone ids I will get a time zone like America/Atka. When I take that id and create a date time with it its time zone id is America/Adak. It is like there are multiple list of time zones in Joda time and they are out of sync."}
