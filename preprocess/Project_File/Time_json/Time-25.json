{"id":25,"summary":"DateTimeZone.getOffsetFromLocal error during DST transition","description": "This may be a failure of my understanding, but the comments in DateTimeZone.getOffsetFromLocal lead me to believe that if an ambiguous local time is given, the offset corresponding to the later of the two possible UTC instants will be returned - i.e. the greater offset.\n\nThis doesn't appear to tally with my experience. In fall 2009, America/Los_Angeles changed from -7 to -8 at 2am wall time on November 11. Thus 2am became 1am - so 1:30am is ambiguous. I would therefore expect that constructing a DateTime for November 11th, 1:30am would give an instant corresponding with the later value (i.e. 9:30am UTC). "}
