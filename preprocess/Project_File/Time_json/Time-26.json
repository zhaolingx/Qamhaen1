{"id":26,"summary":".withHourOfDay() sets hour inconsistantly on DST transition.","description": "When the hour of day is set to the ambiguous hour on the daylight to\nstandard time transition in a given time zone the result is inconsistent for different time zones. Shoul the hour be set to the\ndaylight hour or the standard hour for all time zones? I can't find anything\nthat documents this behavior.\n\nMy test code below returns different results for different time zones. The very last assertion fails on the Australia time zone cutover.\n"}
