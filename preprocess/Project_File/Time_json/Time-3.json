{"id":3,"summary":"addDays(0) changes value of MutableDateTime","description": "Upon DST transition from summer to winter time zone, adding the amount of zero days to a mutable date time object changes the value of the object. The methods addMonths and addYears show the same problem; addSeconds, addMinutes and addHours are ok.\n\nI have tested with version 2.3. However, if I repeat the test with Joda 1.5.2, the invocation of addDays(0) does not change the date's value."}
